# MechaCar_R_Statistical_Analysis
Using R and statistics to analyze vehicle data from the automotive industry, specifically,  the production data of a prototype car.

## Project Background

AutosRUs is an automotive company with more than ten years of market presence. They have recently considered upgrading their decision-making processes to include a thorough statistical analysis component. 

The AutosRUs executive team recognizes that the most successful automobile launches utilize data analytics in every decision-making process. 
The company's data analytics team is in charge of performing retrospective analysis of historical data, analytical verification and validation of current automotive specifications, and studying the design of future product testing. 
Therefore, the analytics team must ensure that their analyses contain a statistical backbone, a quantitative metric, and a clear interpretation of the results to meet the demands of upper management. 

Additionally, the AutosRUs data team consists of five members who prefer to program using R.

This project will perform statistical tests using the R programming language. 
We will provide summary statistics for different variables, visualizations for different datasets, and an interpretation of statistical test results. 
In addition, we will use critical thinking skills to propose a robust study design, hypothesis, and analysis workflow to enhance the AutosRUs manufacturing process.

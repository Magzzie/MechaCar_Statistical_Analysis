# MechaCar_R_Statistical_Analysis
Using R and statistics to analyze vehicle data from the automotive industry, specifically,  the production data of a prototype car.

## Project Background

AutosRUs is an automotive company with more than ten years of market presence. They have recently considered upgrading their decision-making processes to include a thorough statistical analysis component. 

The AutosRUs executive team recognizes that the most successful automobile launches utilize data analytics in every decision-making process. 
The company's data analytics team is in charge of performing retrospective analysis of historical data, analytical verification and validation of current automotive specifications, and studying the design of future product testing. 
Therefore, the analytics team must ensure that their analyses contain a statistical backbone, a quantitative metric, and a clear interpretation of the results to meet the demands of upper management. 

Additionally, the AutosRUs data team consists of five members who prefer to program using R.

More specifically, AutosRUs’ newest prototype, the MechaCar, is suffering from production troubles that are blocking the manufacturing team’s progress.
AutosRUs’ upper management has requested a review of the production data for insights that may help the manufacturing team.


### Purpose


This project will perform statistical tests using the R programming language. 
We will provide summary statistics for different variables, visualizations for different datasets, and an interpretation of statistical test results. 
In addition, we will use critical thinking skills to propose a robust study design, hypothesis, and analysis workflow to enhance the AutosRUs manufacturing process.


## Objectives
1. Linear Regression to Predict MPG
2. Deliverable 2: Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils
3. T-Test on Suspension Coils
4. Design a Study Comparing the MechaCar to the Competition


## Resources
- Data source: [MechaCar MPG dataset](), [Suspension Coil dataset]()
- Software: R (4.2.0), RStudio (2022.07.1-544)
- Libraries & Packages: tidyverse (1.3.1), jsonlite (1.8.0), ggplot2 (3.3.6), ANOVA	,
- Online Tools: 


## Methods

- Statistical Concepts applied: 
	- ETL
	- Visualizations: line, bar, scatter, boxplots, heatmaps.
	- Data Distribution Characteristics
	- Null and Alternative Hypothesis Testing
	- Simple Linear Regression & Multiple Linear Regression
	- One-sample t-Tests, two-sample t-Tests, and Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)
	- Chi-squared test
	- A/B and A/A testing characteristics
	- Determination of the most appropriate statistical test for a given hypothesis and dataset. 






## Results

1. Perform multiple linear regression analysis to identify which variables in the dataset predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes.


2. Collect summary statistics on the pounds per square inch (PSI) of the suspension coils from the manufacturing lots.


3. Run t-tests to determine if the manufacturing lots are statistically different from the mean population.


4. Design a statistical study to compare vehicle performance of the MechaCar vehicles against vehicles from other manufacturers.
- write a summary interpretation of the findings for each statistical analysis.
